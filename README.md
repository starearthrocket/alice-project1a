Version Control

Git was used throughout development.

Workflows demonstrated:

Structured commits.

Reflection

During development, Git conflicts occurred due to branch divergence between local and remote repositories. Resolving these required:

Recovering from detached HEAD state.

This strengthened confidence in real-world Git practices.

UX refinements included:

Backend form handling.

Equipment filtering functionality.
